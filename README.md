## Smart Contract Details

The staking contract uses XRPL Hooks to manage:
- NFT staking and unstaking
- Dynamic reward distribution
- Inner Circle bonus verification
- Early unstaking penalties

### Daily Emission Distribution

- Total daily emission: 500,000 CULT tokens
- Distribution: Equally split among all staked NFTs
- Inner Circle bonus: +20% for qualifying NFTs
- Early unstaking penalty: 25% of accumulated rewards

## Security Considerations

1. All smart contract functions are protected against reentrancy
2. Rewards calculation uses safe math to prevent overflows
3. NFT ownership verification before staking/unstaking
4. No admin privileges or backdoors
5. All critical operations are on-chain and verifiable
